  MilestoneProject - 
  
  I first decided to base the design on a band that plays there music using 
  percusion instruments. There style of music has alot of influence of Jazz, 
  Funk, Soul, RNB, Hip Hop, Motown.
  The wireframe software I designed in was Balsamiq cloud, using the tools to 
  structure the frame of the pages to create individual pages.
  
  The format for the pages where to have a 
  -Banner
  -Container
  -Nav Menu
  
  Each page will be split into individual display boxes for text,images,
  media clips,slides.
  
  Creating the pages 
  -Home
  -Catalogue
  -AV Clips
  -Events
  
  for this band was firstly design a Banner using HTML 
  coding for text format, highlighting the size of letters and the background 
  color.
  The four mentioned pages are Linked to a CSS file, where creating the layout 
  and style of container and display boxes that stand out and easy to 
  navigate from page to page.
  
  The wireframe software allowed me to design and edit the content between this
  site Cloud9 HTML/CSS canvass and Balsamiq. Once the layout for a page was 
  created through Balsamiq. The idea for individual boxes to separate the 
  content and deliver a users experience for reading text, images and slides 
  became easier for me to work from.
  Transferring this over onto Cloud9 canvass using HTML/CSS coding displayed
  the idea I had in mind for this website and linking this to the CSS file 
  will present this in a user friendly design.



  
  The layout for the pages was implemented using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Javascript# badbadnotbad
